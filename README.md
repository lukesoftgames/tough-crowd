### Process

This series of YouTube videos go over the jargon and basics of using Git. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY)

We have a master and beta branches. The master branch will hold a release of the game (something we could ship). The beta branch is a working version of the game. We also have feature branches. A feature branch is used to develop a single feature or fix a bug; try to keep these small - for example I might add a feature branch for a basic movement and another for a basic attack.
Once you have finished developing your feature, submit a pull request to merge your code with beta branch. Someone will review it and once approved will be combined into the beta branch. 

It is a good idea to fetch the beta branch occasionally to makes sure there won't be any suprise merge conflicts.
